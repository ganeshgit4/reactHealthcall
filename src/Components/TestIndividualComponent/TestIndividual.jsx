              <p>A blood glucose test measures the glucose or sugar content in the blood. When we eat carbohydrates our body converts them into glucose to use as energy. Having more or less glucose in our blood leads to serious medical conditions. To diagnose diabetes doctors suggest a blood glucose test. It also helps in managing the sugar level in people who get diagnosed with diabetes. To measure blood glucose levels, a doctor will collect a sample of blood from the vein using a small needle. If you already have diabetes, you can perform a blood glucose test at home using a device that quickly pricks the finger to collect a drop of blood.</p>

              <p>Our Diagnostic Centre is one of the first diagnostic centres in Telangana & Andhra Pradesh that introduced a breakthrough technological advancement in the field of X-ray imaging - the Digital X-Ray, i.e. Computed radiography (CR) & Digital Radiography (DR). With our high end, state-of-the-art, flat-panel detectors technology, with multiple units, we have reached the next level of this basic radiology test.

Contradictory to the Conventional Radiography (CR), Digital X-ray provides a low dose, high resolution and enhanced image quality with no loss in magnification. It also allows the transmission to any place. The need for retakes is also eliminated, apart from a situation of immense significance in Telemedicine.</p>
